		<h2> About Me </h2>
	
	
	<p>
	I am currently wrapping up my 3rd year here at the University of Iowa. I am on the Business Analytics track as well as studying Economics. 
	I enjoy basically anything related to sports. I primarily follow football, basketball, and baseball news. 
	I really enjoy playing basketball and golf. I am also into esports and play Xbox. 
	During the fall and winter I have gotten into hunting. I typically go duck and goose hunting during October/November and then deer hunting, as well as pheasant hunting, during December & January. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I was born in Austin, TX but have grown up in Denver, IA - a town of about 1800 people. I have been blessed with the opportunity to play 4 sports in high school, 
	as well as coach young student athletes. After graduation I hope to be able to continue a coaching career alongside a career in the business field.
