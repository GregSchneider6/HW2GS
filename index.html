	<h2> About Me </h2>
	
	<br>
	
	
	I am currently a 3rd year here at the University of Iowa. I am on the Business Analytics track as well as studying Economics. 
	I enjoy basically anything related to sports. I primarily follow football, basketball, and baseball news. 
	I really enjoy playing basketball and golf. I am also into esports and play Xbox. 
	During the fall and winter I have gotten into hunting. I typically go duck & goose hunting during October/November and then deer hunting, as well as pheasant hunting, during December & January.
